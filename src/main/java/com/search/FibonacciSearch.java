 * Fibonacci search is a method of searching a sorted array using a divide and conquer algorithm that narrows down
 * possible locations with the aid of Fibonacci numbers. Compared to binary search where the sorted array is divided
 * into two equal-sized parts, one of which is examined further, Fibonacci search divides the array into two parts that
 * have sizes that are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
 * <p>
 * Worst-case performance	O(Log n)
 * Best-case performance	O(1)
 * Average performance	O(Log n)
 * Average space complexity	O(1)
