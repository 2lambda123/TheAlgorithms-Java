/**
 * In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal
 * with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created.
 * This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method—either specified in an interface and implemented by
 * child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes—rather than by calling
 * a constructor.
