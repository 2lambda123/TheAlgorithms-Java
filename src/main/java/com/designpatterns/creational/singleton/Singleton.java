/**
 * The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance.
 * This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The term comes from the
 * mathematical concept of a singleton.
 * <p>
 * The key idea in this pattern is to make the class itself responsible for controlling its instantiation (only once).
 * The hidden constructor (declared private) ensures that the class can never be instantiated from outside the class.
 * The public static operation can be accessed easily by using the class name and function name(Singleton.getInstance())
 *
 * @see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">Singleton Pattern</a>
