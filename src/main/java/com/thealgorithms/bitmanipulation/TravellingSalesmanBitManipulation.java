    /** 
     * @brief
     * The below algorithm is called as Travelling Salesman Using Bit-manipulation.
     * We can use this algorithm to improve the  naive algorithmâ€™s performance.
     * @detail
     * Given the distance/cost(as and adjacency matrix) between each city/node to the other city/node,
     * the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once
     * and returns to the starting point, or we can say the minimum cost of whole tour.

     * Explanation
     * INPUT -> You are given with an adjacency matrix A = {} which contains the distance between two cities/node.
     * OUTPUT ->  Minimum cost of whole tour from starting point
     * The Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n^2 * 2^n)
     * Space complexity: O(n)
