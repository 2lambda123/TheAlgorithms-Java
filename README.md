NOTE: We are reorganizing the code in this repo to use the traditional Java package structure. We created the 
[Development](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/tree/Development) branch for this purpose, and we recommend
using the [Development](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/tree/Development) branch for all contributions.
Please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues/474) for more information.

You can run and edit the algorithms, or contribute to them, using Gitpod.io (a free online development environment) with a single click.

### All algorithms are implemented in Java (for educational purposes)
These implementations are intended for learning purposes. As such, they may be less efficient than the Java standard library.
