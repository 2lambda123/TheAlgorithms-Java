## Steps to cloning the repository
1. Navigate to the main page of the repository
2. Above the list of files (and to the right of the button "Add file") is a button called Code (Usually in Green), Click it.
3. Copy the URL for the repository:
   - To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "HTTPS", click .
   - To clone the repository using an SSH key, including a certificate issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority, click SSH, then click .
   - To clone a repository using GitHub CLI, click GitHub CLI, then click .
4. Open Git Bash (or your preferred terminal) and navigate your working directory to the location you'd like to create the local clone.
5. Once you're in your desired working directory, type `git clone` and paste the copied URL from step 3.

It should look  something like this.
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```
6. Finally, press enter to create your local clone!
