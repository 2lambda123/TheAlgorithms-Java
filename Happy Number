/*A number is called happy if it leads to 1 or 7 after a sequence of steps wherein each step number is replaced by 
the sum of squares of its digit that is if we start with Happy Number and keep replacing it with digits square sum, 
we reach 1 or 7. 
EXAMPLE:
Input: n = 19
Output: The number you entered is a Happy Number
19 is Happy Number,
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
As we reached to 1, 19 is a Happy Number.

Input: n = 20
Output: The number you entered is NOT a Happy Number
